# Goldfish-clone-JLCPCB

This board is a new layout for the original 
[Goldfish](https://github.com/staticintlucas/Goldfish)
by Lucas Jansen.

## Why?

This board was designed to be used with JLCPCB's SMD assembly service.  Because JLCPCB has very different requirements,
the board layout needed redesigned entirely.

## Important changes

* Four layer board with separate ground and power layers.  No additional charge, so why not?
* Board is wider to meet the minimum width requirements
* The board is longer to allow top-side labels all the way around
* Changed the USB connector to one that is more easily soldered by hand and the cost of being slightly thicker.
* Changed the crystal to match parts available.
* 0 Ohm resisters added to help USB data signal routing
* Additional USB Datapins removed.

## Revision History

* Rev A - Initial release.  On order - untested.
